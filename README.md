## Description
A pre-existing backend providing REST API endpoints was used as the foundation for this project. Based on this API, I built the frontend using Vue 3 + TS + TailwindCSS.<br>

As a result the Upload App is a secure and modern web application that allows authenticated users to upload, store, manage, and share files.

## Key Functionalities
🔐 Secure authentication with JWT (access tokens in state, refresh tokens in HTTP-only cookies) and automatic token renewal handled by an API interceptor<br>
📂 File uploads with public/private visibility<br>
📥 Secure file downloading with access restrictions based on file visibility<br>
🧾 Real-time preview and file detail management<br>

## What I Learned

- Building reusable and universal components
- Applying a feature-based architecture
